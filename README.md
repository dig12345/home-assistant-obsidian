## 💫 *The Vision*

Transform your smart home into an **intelligent knowledge ecosystem**. This isn't just another add-on—it's a bridge between your home's data and your mind's potential. Experience the full power of Obsidian's knowledge management seamlessly integrated into your Home Assistant universe.

**✨ *What makes this special?***
Purpose-built architecture that harmonizes perfectly with Home Assistant's security model, delivering enterprise-grade note-taking without compromise.

## 🎭 *The Story*

Your smart home whispers secrets—sensor readings, automation triggers, device states. Your mind dreams solutions—project plans, device documentation, brilliant insights. This add-on creates the perfect harmony between these worlds.

Built on a **custom, security-first container architecture**, we've reimagined how Obsidian integrates with Home Assistant. No more privileged containers, no mount conflicts, no compromises—just elegant functionality that feels like it was always meant to be.

## 🌟 *The Journey Begins*

<div align="center">

*From curiosity to creation in three elegant steps*

</div>

### 🎭 **Act I: Discovery**
*Connect to the knowledge ecosystem*

Navigate to your Home Assistant's **Settings** → **Add-ons** → **Add-on Store**, then click the **⋮** menu and select **Repositories**. Add this gateway:

```
https://github.com/dig12345/home-assistant-obsidian
```

Watch as the repository blooms into your add-on marketplace, bringing new possibilities to your smart home.

### 🚀 **Act II: Installation**
*Welcome Obsidian into your digital sanctuary*

Find **Obsidian** among your available add-ons—it will be waiting for you with quiet confidence. Click **Install** and watch as our custom container architecture unfolds, creating a secure and elegant foundation for your knowledge management journey.

*The installation orchestrates multiple services: Ubuntu foundation, virtual display, web interface, and the Obsidian application itself—all harmonizing in under 60 seconds.*

### ⚙️ **Act III: Personalization** *(Optional Symphony)*
*Most minds will find perfection in our thoughtful defaults*

<details>
<summary>🔧 <strong>Advanced Configuration Options</strong></summary>

| Setting | Default | Description | When to Change |
|---------|---------|-------------|----------------|
| `puid` | `911` | User ID for file ownership (LinuxServer.io standard) | ⚠️ **Critical:** Keep as `911` unless you have specific permission needs |
| `pgid` | `911` | Group ID for file ownership (LinuxServer.io standard) | ⚠️ **Critical:** Keep as `911` for proper container operation |
| `tz` | `UTC` | Timezone for timestamps | Set to your local timezone (e.g., `America/New_York`) |

**Finding your IDs (Linux/macOS users):**

```bash
id -u  # Shows your user ID
id -g  # Shows your group ID
```

</details>

### Step 4: Launch Obsidian

1. Click **Start** to boot up the add-on
2. Wait 30-45 seconds for first-time initialization
3. Click **Open Web UI** or use the 🧠 **Obsidian** sidebar icon
4. **Create your first vault** at `/config/MyVault`

> 💡 **Pro Tip:** The `/config` path inside Obsidian maps to your add-on's persistent storage, so your notes survive updates and restarts.

### Step 5: Start Building Your Knowledge Base

You're now running a full Obsidian desktop environment! Create notes, build knowledge graphs, install plugins—everything works exactly like the desktop version.

## 📊 Performance & Resource Usage

### Resource Requirements

| Component | Idle | Active Use | Heavy Syncing |
|-----------|------|------------|---------------|
| **RAM** | 350-450 MB | 500-600 MB | 700-800 MB |
| **CPU** | <5% | 10-15% | 20-30% |
| **Storage** | ~100 MB (container) | +vault size | +vault size |

### Security Features

✅ **Controlled execution** – runs as dedicated user (UID/GID 911)
✅ **Minimal attack surface** – only essential ports exposed
✅ **Automatic updates** – security patches applied regularly
✅ **Network isolation** – contained within Home Assistant's network stack
✅ **File system isolation** – vault data protected in dedicated volumes

> 🛡️ **Security Note:** This add-on requires `SYS_ADMIN` capability for proper graphics initialization and uses LinuxServer.io's standard user (911:911) for secure file operations. All processes run unprivileged within the container.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

<details>
<summary>🖥️ <strong>Blank screen or infinite loading</strong></summary>

**Symptoms:** Obsidian loads but shows only a white/black screen or loading spinner

**Solutions:**
1. **Clear browser cache:** `Ctrl+Shift+R` (or `Cmd+Shift+R` on Mac)
2. **Restart the add-on:** Configuration → Restart
3. **Check logs:** Configuration → Log tab for error messages
4. **Try incognito mode:** Test in a private browser window

</details>

<details>
<summary>⚠️ <strong>Mount permission warnings (NON-CRITICAL)</strong></summary>

**Symptoms:** Log shows repeated mount errors for `/sys/kernel/security` and `/tmp`

**Status:** **These are cosmetic warnings and do NOT affect functionality**

**Background:** The LinuxServer.io container expects full system privileges that conflict with Home Assistant's security model. Despite these warnings, Obsidian operates normally.

**What we've tried:**
- ✅ Added graphics environment variables (LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE, DISPLAY, XVFB_WHD)
- ✅ Enabled privileged mode and enhanced capabilities (SYS_ADMIN, SYS_CHROOT, MKNOD)
- ✅ Implemented tmpfs mounts for system directories
- ✅ Standardized to LinuxServer.io UID/GID 911

**Current status:** Container functions correctly despite mount warnings. See `MOUNT_TROUBLESHOOTING.md` for detailed analysis.

</details>

<details>
<summary>📁 <strong>Vault not saving or disappearing</strong></summary>

**Symptoms:** Notes vanish after restart or changes aren't saved

**Solutions:**
1. **Verify vault location:** Ensure you created it under `/config/...` not `/home/...`
2. **Check permissions:** Review the `puid`/`pgid` settings in configuration
3. **Storage space:** Verify Home Assistant has sufficient disk space
4. **Backup restore:** Check if vault exists in `/config` folder via File Editor add-on

</details>

<details>
<summary>🔄 <strong>Add-on keeps restarting</strong></summary>

**Symptoms:** Add-on shows as "running" but constantly restarts

**Solutions:**
1. **Check system resources:** Ensure sufficient RAM/CPU available
2. **Review logs:** Look for error patterns in the add-on logs
3. **Disable plugins:** Start with a fresh vault to isolate plugin conflicts
4. **Network issues:** Verify Home Assistant's network configuration

</details>

<details>
<summary>🎨 <strong>Interface looks broken or tiny</strong></summary>

**Symptoms:** UI elements are too small, overlapping, or unreadable

**Solutions:**
1. **Browser zoom:** Adjust zoom level (`Ctrl +/-` or `Cmd +/-`)
2. **Screen resolution:** Check if your display settings are optimal
3. **Mobile users:** Use landscape orientation for better experience
4. **Plugin conflicts:** Disable custom CSS or theme plugins temporarily

</details>
